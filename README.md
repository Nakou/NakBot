## Concept
Making a bot which can :
Respond to the command /roll (and roll a dice)
Respond to some phrases (like Slackbot, will be probably removed 'cause Slackbot is doing it perfectly and since the point 3 is functionnal)
AND : Take message from Slack, and post them into the same-name channel on a Discord server, and vice-versa.
